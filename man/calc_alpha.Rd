\title{Compute Cronbach's Coefficient Alpha}
\usage{
calc_alpha(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or matrix with one row per observation and one column per item.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving Cronbach's alpha (typically in [0, 1], but
can be outside this range for problematic data).
}
\description{
\code{calc_alpha()} computes Cronbach's coefficient alpha for a set of items from
the \strong{unstandardized covariance} matrix. Items are coerced to numeric before
calculation. Missing data can be handled via \strong{pairwise} deletion.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{k} be the number of items and let \eqn{X_1,\ldots,X_k} denote the item
scores. Define the total score \eqn{T = \sum_{i=1}^k X_i}. Cronbach's alpha can be
written without matrix notation as
\deqn{\alpha \;=\; \frac{k}{k-1}\left(1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k \mathrm{Var}(X_i)}{\mathrm{Var}(T)}\right).}
In words: take the sum of the item variances and divide by the variance of the
total score; subtract this ratio from 1 and multiply by \eqn{k/(k-1)}.

Both \eqn{\mathrm{Var}(X_i)} and \eqn{\mathrm{Var}(T)} are
computed using pairwise-complete observations.

\section{Coercion}{

Each column is coerced via \code{as.numeric()}. This means:
\itemize{
\item factors are converted to \strong{integer level codes} (not labels);
\item characters that are not parsable as numbers become \code{NA};
\item dates/times become their underlying numeric representations.
Ensure your columns are truly numeric item responses or pre-process as needed.
