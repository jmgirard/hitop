\usage{
rank_scales(
  data,
  scales,
  prefix = NULL,
  top = 5,
  dir = "high",
  append = TRUE,
  tibble = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the scale columns.}

\item{scales}{A character or integer vector identifying the columns in
\code{data} to rank (names or positions). These columns should be numeric.}

\item{prefix}{A length-1 string giving a leading pattern to strip from each
selected column name before concatenation, or \code{NULL} to keep names as
is. The match is interpreted as a regular expression anchored to the start
of the name (i.e., \code{"^"} is prepended). Special regex characters in
\code{prefix} will be treated as regex metacharacters.}

\item{top}{Integer (length 1). The number of columns to include per row
after ranking. Must be between 1 and \code{length(scales)}.}

\item{dir}{Direction of ranking: \code{"high"} for largest values first or
\code{"low"} for smallest values first.}

\item{append}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, bind the result as a new column to
\code{data}. If \code{FALSE}, return only the result vector.}

\item{tibble}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, coerce the output to a tibble via
\code{tibble::as_tibble()} (applies whether or not \code{append} is
\code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
If \code{append = FALSE} and \code{tibble = FALSE}: a character vector of
length \code{nrow(data)} where each element is a comma-separated list of the
selected scale names in ranked order.

If \code{append = TRUE}: a data frame (or tibble if \code{tibble = TRUE})
equal to \code{data} with an added character column \code{out}.

If \code{append = FALSE} and \code{tibble = TRUE}: a tibble with one column
\code{out}.
}
\description{
For each row of selected scale columns, return a comma-separated string of
the \code{top} highest (or lowest) scale names, optionally removing a common
\code{prefix} from the column names and optionally appending the result to
the original data as a tibble.
}
\details{
Ranking is performed row-wise using \code{order()} on the selected columns.
Ties are resolved by the original column order (the default behavior of
\code{order}), which is alphabetical if using the package's scoring
functions. Missing values are placed last by \code{order()} and will be
included only if there are fewer than \code{top} non-missing values in a row.

If \code{prefix} is not \code{NULL}, the function removes the leading
pattern \code{paste0("^", prefix)} from each selected column name before
concatenation.

When \code{append = TRUE}, the appended column is named \code{"out"}.
The order of existing columns in \code{data} is preserved.
