\title{Score the Full PID-5 Validity Scales}
\usage{
validity_pid5(
  data,
  items,
  scales = c("PNA", "INC", "ORS", "PRD", "SDTD"),
  srange = c(0, 3),
  append = TRUE,
  tibble = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{items}{An optional vector of column names (as strings) or numbers (as
integers) corresponding to the 220 PID-5 items in order. If set to \code{NULL}
(the default), all non-\code{id} columns will be assumed to be the \code{items} in
order.}

\item{scales}{An optional character vector indicating which of the following
validity scales to calculate: percent missing items (\code{"PNA"}), response
inconsistency scale (\code{"INC"}), overreporting scale (\code{"ORS"}), positive
impression management response distortion scale (\code{"PRD"}), and social
desirability-total denial scale (\code{"SDTD"}). See details below for
interpretation guidance.}

\item{srange}{An optional numeric vector specifying the minimum and maximum
values of the PID-5 items, used for reverse-coding. (default = \code{c(0, 3)})}

\item{tibble}{An optional logical indicating whether the output should be
converted to a \code{tibble::tibble()}.}

\item{.data}{A data frame containing all PID-5 items (numerically scored).}

\item{id}{An optional vector of column names (as strings) or numbers (as
integers) corresponding to variables from \code{.data} to keep in the output. If
set to \code{NULL} (the default), no columns will be retained.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing any \code{id} variables as well any requested
\code{scale} scores.
}
\description{
Create a data frame with scores on the full PID-5 validity scales.
}
\details{
A score of 17 or higher on the INC is indicative of inconsistent
responding. A score of 3 or higher on the ORS is indicative of
overreporting. A score of 10 or lower on the PRD is indicative of positive
impression management (underreporting rather than genuine responding)
whereas a score of 21 or higher on the PRD is indicative of genuine
responding (rather than positive impression management). A score of 11 or
lower on the SDTD is indicative of social desirability (rather than
defensiveness), whereas a score of 19 or higher on the SDTD is indicative
of defensiveness (rather than social desirability).
