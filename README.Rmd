# hitop

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of *hitop* is to provide functions helpful for researchers working on the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP). For now, this includes functions for scoring the PID-5 and HiTOP-PRO. However, more features will be added soon. Note that I recently refactored things so the `validity_pid5()` function is currently out-of-order; however, I should be able to fix this in the next few days.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hitop from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jmgirard/hitop")
```
