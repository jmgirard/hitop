The goal of *hitop* is to provide functions helpful for the Hierarchical
Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) Society. For now, this includes functions
for scoring the PID-5 and HiTOP-PRO aimed primarily at researchers. However,
more features will be added soon, including features aimed primarily at
clinicians.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hitop from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jmgirard/hitop")
```
