# hitop

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of *hitop* is to provide functions helpful for researchers
working on the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP). For
now, this includes functions for scoring the PID-5 and HiTOP-PRO.
However, more features will be added soon. Note that I recently
refactored things so the `validity_pid5()` function is currently
out-of-order; however, I should be able to fix this in the next few
days.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hitop from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jmgirard/hitop")
