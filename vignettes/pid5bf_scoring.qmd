### Score simulated PID-5-BF data

Finally, the PID-5-BF is a brief version with 25 items that yields the domain scores only. The only validity scale that is calculable with this subset of items is the percentage of missing items (PNA). 

```{r}
data("sim_pid5bf")

score_pid5(sim_pid5bf, items = 1:25, version = "BF", append = FALSE)

validity_pid5(sim_pid5bf, items = 1:25, version = "BF", append = FALSE)
```
